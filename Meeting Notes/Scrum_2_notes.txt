Scrum Meeting 2 Notes (3/31)
- We have not made any new progress on tasks, but are working on continuing to plan out our tasks
- We are also working on finalizing our tech stack
- Planning on looking into Svelte and going through some of their tutorials to familiarize ourselves with it
- Peter updated us following the scrum manager meeting
- Most teams are using node/react/express and JavaScript
- We are considering using Svelte to make it easier, since it is more lightweight
- Confirmed goals of having a preliminary front end at the end of this sprint, can revise CSS and JavaScript later
