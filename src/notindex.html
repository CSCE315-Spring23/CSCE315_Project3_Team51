      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. It involves creating algorithms and computer programs that can recognize patterns, learn from data, and make decisions without human intervention.</p>
